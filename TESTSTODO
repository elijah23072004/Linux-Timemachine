Have folder for test data
where set input folders
with set output folders

e.g. 
input1:
originalData
input2: 
orignalDataChanged

output1:
empty folder
output2:
folder when output1 backed up to (time before input2 data changed) 
with input2 as input folder
output3: 
folder with 10 differential backups (with folder input3 as input) to test if 
program does full backup
output4:
deleted file in input folder to test

can use other output folders to test file tree 
and recovery of files 


use this to make a test suite


these will test with compression off when that functionality is added 



will need cleanup scripts to run at end of each individual test to make 
sure output folders are unchanged 

to test backup 
can backup and have alternate versions of output folders with correct diffs 
and to test recovery can compare recovered files to original 
and make sure that files are identical to make sure that test works 

test that recover wont recover a deleted file 
(if it was deleted in a previous backup then dont recover that file unless recovering 
from previous backup or older)


will need to test error codes on backup functions 
so will need specific input folders which will error

also test log files to make sure correct output exists 
(will need to generate the correct output since the log file data will depend when 
program
executed) could be done by storing epoch tiem of start of bakup and end 
and make sure that each value in the log file is between the values and in 
ascending order 



also test that backups before the last full backup can be recovered 
(currently they can't be)



when compression is added 
do all tests above again with compression 
and test if it can find compressed file
and if it can recover and create compressed file 
and if it combines files into a zip of correct size or smaller

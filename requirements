extra requirement for diss 
meson build system 
as it is the build system used to 
compile the project 

(can be installed without meson but 
would require linking each
individual file

requires gtk 4.10 
so debian and ubutnu only have support for 
gtk 4.8
for debian to have a gkmm4 package that supports 4.10 need to run instable install of debian
however arch and some other deskop distributions support gtk 4.10

ubuntu package required 
libgtkmm-4.0-dev
meson 

debian 
libgtkmm-4.0-dev
meson

tset
glib2.0



arch package required
meson 
gtkmm-4.0
